# Arrow functions, the basics

## There’s another very simple and concise syntax for creating functions, that’s often better than Function Expressions.

### It’s called “arrow functions”, because it looks like this:

```js
let func = (arg1, arg2, ..., argN) => expression;
```

### This creates a function func that accepts arguments arg1..argN, then evaluates the expression on the right side with their use and returns its result.
