# Scripts in javascript.

. Scripts in javascript hold the content of javascript logic

## There are two types of script;

### 1. External.

If we have a lot of JavaScript code, we can put it into a separate file.

Script files are attached to HTML with the src attribute:

#### an example;

```js
<script src="alert.js"></script>
```

### 2. Inline.

#### example is;

```js
<script>alert("Hello javascript");</script>
```

## Advantages of External Scripts

. Benefits of a separete file is that the browser will download it and store it in its cache making it easyly accessible hence reduces traffic and makes pages faster.
